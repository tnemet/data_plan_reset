# data_plan_reset
Due to restrictions imposed by my telecom provider on downloads per session, I have decided to automate the process of resetting the data limit by integrating a script into my OpenWrt system. This script will collect information about data transferred through a specified connection and then send an SMS code to the telecom provider to reset the data limit.
